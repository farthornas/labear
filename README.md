A project to learn some deep learning... 

Code is based on this article: https://towardsdatascience.com/audio-deep-learning-made-simple-sound-classification-step-by-step-cebc936bbe5 

Links to dataset and metadata can be found in the article. The dataset/metadata will be expanded upon with sounds from home/labs/etc. We should find a place to store this which we can both access. For recordings I've used the app Voice Recorder (V 3.19) which records .wav format to my phone.
