# Running the KIVY app on your machine

This is what will become the iOS and Android app

## Getting started 

Make sure you [have poetry installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

Do `poetry install` to set up the virtual environment and install dependencies.

## Running the App

For the app to not crash when uploading the recordings, the API needs to be running. To run the API have a look at the API README.

Once the API is running:

Do `poetry run python kivy/AudioMon.py` to start up the application
